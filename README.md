FixIt
designed by Brittany Weickert and Ryan Kadel

The App is designed with people who have recently damaged their smartphones in mind.
The user enters the smartphone model and they are shown a list of youtube videos that demonstrate the repair

If they are less bold they can also enter their zip code which will display a map of their area with markers for local repair shops

This app uses the youtube API to display the videos
Google's cloud platform - geocode api to turn their zip code into usable lat an long numbers
and maps javascript api to display the results as markers on a map of their area.

The lists of shops are populated using Foursquare's search API
