The App is designed with people who have recently damaged their smartphones in mind.
The user enters the smartphone model and zip code and they are shown a list of youtube videos that demonstrate the repair for the DIY'er
as well as a map of their area with markers and list for local repair shops If they are less bold

This app uses the youtube API to display the videos
Google's cloud platform - geocode api to turn their zip code into usable lat an long numbers
and maps javascript api to display the results as markers on a map of their area.
The lists of shops are populated using Foursquare's search API

The other technologies used are HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery
